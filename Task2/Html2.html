			<h4>Book definicion</h4>
	<p>
	There are no ways to determine how many books are there in the world. It's their
	number that is the proof of the extraordinary dynamism of the publishing industry 
	because 
	<samp>"Every year tens of thousands of new books come to the market" </samp>
	<sub>(Miller 2007:69)</sub>  and because every 30 seconds a new book is publish 
	<sup>(Zaid 2003:21)</sup>. Nevertheless, it's not
	quite clear what the tearm <s>"book"</s> <bdo dir="rtl" >implies</bdo>:
	is often mentioned
	<abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
	Organization">UNESCO</abbr>-es definition according to which the book is burdened
	printed publication of at least<mark>49 pages</mark>.

	<dfn><strong>Electronic books</strong></dfn> have more appearances than printed,

	<s>Jeff Gomez</s> is a representative of authors who declare <small>"death to"</small>
	<em>printed books</em>. <q>It is thought that they donot have a future because 
	they will be squeezed out by electronic texts, but the publisher's role is still 
	considered unapproved</q>. 
	List of five reasons why publishers will survive in the digital age:

	<div class="pozadina">
	<ul class="list">
	<li>
	they will find talented authors because the publisher's job is to disclose texts
	worth reading</li>

	they will be supported by gifted authors, because "even the genius needs the editor"</li>
	<li>
	they will provide gifted authors with visibility and promotion of works in digital
	environment</li>
	<li>
	they will sell works of art and, as they have done so far, will pay for the author's fees.
