	<h4>General</h4>

	There are a number of IT companies in Osijek, some of which have been existing for 
	many years, who successfully operate in the international market. The others are 
	slightly younger, but they are already managing to impose themselves as the 
	authorities in their business niches or are on the best path to become them. 
	These companies employ professionals, produce quality software and export
	many markets around the world. That's because some of them are mostly oriented
	or completely exported, they aren't often known in the domestic market, even though 
	they do business better than most other companies in their environment. By presenting 
	these companies and their work in the local community they want to show, despite 
	the current economic situation,willingness to work.

	<h4>Direction of Education</h4>
	The fact is that formal education in Croatia is not a guarantee of finding a job.
	Formal education programs are largely inconsistent with the real needs of the market
	work, and even less prevision of what kind of knowledge and skills might be needed 
	in a few years time to help young people decide on enrollment in high school or at
	faculty and based on this information they could consider their future occupation. The
	the system of formal education can not be so easily influenced, but in this way it could
	help encourage people of all ages and professions (high school students, students, unemployed,
	dissatisfied with the current status, etc.) to grow education for their niches wants 
	in which they would like to work, as well as to introduce them to the IT niches in
	which, with the required knowledge, could easily be employable.

	<p><h2>Association </h2>
	<pre>One year after launching the Osijek Software City project, it was time to formalize 
	the initiative, so on February 21. 2013. the Founding Assembly of the Association
	Osijek Software City was held.  The founding of an association did  not change the 
	approach and mode of operation, which  has been well received and has had quite good 
	results so far; that's just a step further in dedication to the goals set and giving 
	greater administrative freedom because the association is now legal and financially 
	independent of the companies involved. The current Governing Board meeting (July 2015 - 
	June 2017) consists of representatives of companies Adcon, Cobe, Inchoo, Mono, Prototype.
	The current president of the Association is Denis Sušac (Mono), while Bela Ikotić
	(Entrepreneurial Incubator BIOS) is secretary general of the Association. According to the 
	Statute of the Association, a member of the Association may become any domestic or foreign 
	natural person.
